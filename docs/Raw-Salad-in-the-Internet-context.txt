RAW SALAD IN THE INTERNET CONTEXT

Raw Salad provides a collection of mechanisms for making a heavy use of the 
Internet context of the application. All of them are based on open and widely 
recognised web standards. 

PUBLIC API
Raw Salad features two separate API mechanisms, each serving different 
functionality. On the one hand there is a classic public API letting users 
easily grab the data from Raw Salad's database. On the other hand a public API 
specification will be provided letting Raw Salad work with data from external 
databases as far as the database holder will implement this specification as 
a public access to his/her data. 

PERMALINKS
Each view in Raw Salad generates a permalink (see: URL-structure.txt in 
/Raw-Salad/docs). This will enable users to share their work easily and 
save interesting views as a bookmark. 

IFRAME
All visualizations prepared by the users will generate a ready-to-paste HTML 
code for embedding the resulting picture as an IFrame on user's blog, website 
or social network profile. This is the only way Raw Salad let's users discuss 
on public data collected in the application.
