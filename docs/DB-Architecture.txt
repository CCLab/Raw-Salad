DATA STORAGE SETUP
There are 2 storages used for different purposes:

    1. PostgreSQL - used as a main storage for table-like raw data;
    2. mongoDB - used as a storage of:
        - site navigator - the scheme of the web-site navigation
        - meta-data of the main raw data storage
        - snapshots
        - raw data, semi-structured (future use)

POSTGRESQL
The basic setup of the server:
    server: PostgreSQL version 8.4
    database name: rawstbl00 
        where "raw" is a project name ("Raw Salad"), 
              "tbl" tells about the database type (table), 
              "00" is a version of the database
    port: 5432
    additional software:
        Python interface: psycopg2
        
The database rawsql00 is a single storage for all the raw data of two different 
models: Budget and Polls statistics. And despite the fact that all the domains,
tables, cursors and constraints will be named differently due to the semantic 
independence, every name should be preceded with a namespace: 

    <model namespace>_<object name>

The exceptions are domains that can be used in both models (e.g. long_descr 
that would work both for the data unit "Granice obwodu" of Local Polls as well
as "Cel" of Budget as unlimited varchar data type).

    <model namespace>s are: "lp" for "Local Polls", "bt" for "Budget"

Examples of tablenames in the Local Polls scheme: 
    lp_kandydaci_urzad
    lp_kandydaci_urzad, 
    lp_obwody
    lp_komitety
    
Examples of tablenames in the Budget scheme: 
    bt_cel 
    bt_main
    bt_instytucja
    
Every table and every column of each table should be coded specially and those 
codes should be stored in a special collection in the database of mongoDB
(see description below).

MONGODB - GENERAL SETUP
The basic setup:
    server: mongoDB version 1.6.5 64bit
    database name: rawsdoc00
        where "raws" is a project name ("Raw Salad")
              "doc" refers to db type (document oriented)
              "00" is a version
    port: 28017
    additional software:
        Python interface: pymongo 1.9

MONGODB - COLLECTIONS NAMESPACES
All the data in mongoDB are stored in a single database, but separate
collections.
There are 2 kinds of collections:
- actual data
- meta data

Any collection which stores the data for site navigation or any other
site-specific task is being considered as of 'meta data' kind

Naming collections:
<KK>_<TTTT><YYYY>_<descr>, where:
- <KK> (2 symbols) describes the kind of a collection: 'dd' (data),
'dr' (reference), 'md' (meta-data),  'ms' (meta-site), 'zz'
(collections for auxilar purposes)
- <TTTT> (4 symbols) indicates to what data-set a collection
belong (examples: 'budg' - 'budget', 'poll' - local polls, etc.). A
special data-set 'aaaa' is for references that can be used in different
data-sets
- <YYYY> (4 symbols) - year (if it makes sense for a collection, if
not - 'XXXX')
- <descr> - description

In the names of the meta-data collections ('md') the year is absent:
<KK>_<TTTT>_<descr>

In the names of the collections connected to site structure ('ms') the
year and and the code of the data-set are absent:
<KK>_<descr>

Symbols allowed: Latin alphabet letters (ASCII), numbers and symbol '_'

Examples:
dd_budg2011_go - goal oriented budget 2011
dd_budg2011_tr - traditional budget 2011
dd_budg2012_fc - budget 'Funduszy celowe' 2011
dd_poll2010_kandydaci_rady - local polls 2010: Kandydaci Rady
dr_aaaaXXXX_teryt - territory code TERYT
md_budg_scheme
md_poll_scheme
ms_nav - site navigation



MONGODB - NAVIGATOR
This provides web framework with the objects with information about the scheme
of hi level navigation of the web-site, such as:
    1st step - selection of the data set (collection): 
        "Budżet centralny"
        "Wybory lokalne"
    2nd step - selection of the perspective (view):
        "Budżet centralny":
            "Budżet zadaniowy"
            "Budżet instytucjonalny"
            "Budżet księgowy"
        "Wybory lokalne": 
            "Wybory wójtów, burmistrzów i prezydentów miast"
            "Sejmiki wojewódzkie"
            
The structure is represented by the collection m_site_nav (navigator) 
with the items arranged as follows:
[
    {
    "pos": /position of the appearance 1, 2, ..., n/,
    "func": /"collection" on the highest level/,
    "name": /name as it appears on the web-page/,
    "url": /relative URL as described in the paragraph "URLs"/,

    "descr": /description as it appears on the web-page/,

    "long_descr": /html code of the long description as it 
                  appears on the web-page/,
    "view": [ /array of views inside the collection/
        {
        "pos": /position of the appearance 1, 2, ..., n/,
        "func": /"collection" on the highest level/,
        "name": /name as it appears on the web-page/,
        "url": /relative URL as described in the paragraph "URLs"/,
        "descr": /description as it appears on the web-page/,
        "long_descr": /html code of the long description as 
                      it appears on the web-page/
        }, 
        { ... }
        ]
    },
    { 
    ... 
    }
]

MONGODB - SCHEMES OF THE MAIN RAW DATA STORAGE
There should be as many of collections with meta-data as many models
there's is in the project (in Raw-Salad it is 2).
Meta-data should include information not only about the structure of the storage
(such as column names, types, whether a column can be aggregated or not, etc.),
but also the nature of the data ("table" - for SQL tables, and "document" - for
non-SQL collections of documents).
Every such scheme should map the column names of the table in the PostgreSQL
database to a letter taken from the URL (a to x) as described in the document
URL-structure, which would pass from client to the server sufficient information
about the tables/collections and their columns/keys to extract.

The form of the mapping is as follows:
[
    { // collection (table) lp_okregi 
    "col_code": "g" //how collection appears in the URL 
    "col_name": "lp_okregi",
    "col_local_name": "okręgi",
    "col_descr": "Electoral district",
    "col_descr_full": "Okręgi wyborczy",

    "col_keys": {

       "a": {  //how key (column) appears in the URL
             "key_name": "teryt",
             "key_type": "string",
             "key_aggr": False,
             "key_label": "Kod terytorialny",

       },
        "xxxx": { ... },

       "e": {
             "key_name": "liczba_komitetow",
             "key_type": "int",
             "key_aggr": True,
             "key_label": "Liczba komitetów"

       },
        { ... }
    },

    { // collection (table) lp_kandydaci_urzad
    "col_code": "h" //how collection appears in the URL 
    "col_name": "lp_kandydaci_urzad",
    "col_local_name": "kandydaci_urząd",
    "col_descr": "local governmental polls, Poland 2010",
    "col_descr_full": "...",

   "col_keys": {

       "a": {
             "key_name": "gmina",
             "key_type": "string",
             "key_aggr": False,
             "key_label": "Gmina",

       },

       "b": {
             "key_name": "szczebel",
             "key_type": "string",
             "key_aggr": False,
             "key_label": "Szczebel",

       },
        "xxxx": { ... },

       "t": {
             "key_name": "l_glosow",
             "key_type": "int",
             "key_aggr": True,
             "key_label": "Liczba głosów"

       },

       "u": {
             "key_name": "proc_glosow",
             "key_type": "float",
             "key_aggr": True,
             "key_label": "% głosów"

       }
    },

    {
    ... 
    },
]
