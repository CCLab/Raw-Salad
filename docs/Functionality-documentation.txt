GENERAL WORKFLOW INFORMATION

THREE VIEWS
The basic work-flow of Raw Salad consists of three successive parts: Choose, 
Browse and Use. This is the only way of working with the application and no 
short-cuts omitting one of the parts are provided. Each of these parts is 
represented by a single web page (the view) and with one more helper pop-up 
these three web pages closes a collection of possible views in Raw Salad. This 
will let us graphically and functionally separate these parts and make it clear
and easy to learn for the users.

DATA ON DEMAND
One of the main ideas incorporated in the application design is the Data On 
Demand approach. From the user point of view that means that no data are 
provided to the user unless she or he directly asks for them. This will allow 
us to achieve two goals: 
    * user is never overloaded with data s/he didn't want to see and work with
    * the system can make a heavy use of asynchronous database requests making 
      the system more efficient and user experience much more responsive 
      (possibly no data download lags). 

SNAPSHOTS

RICH DOWNLOAD
Another feature present across the application is rich download functionality. 
In every step user can download the data of interest. This is split into three 
basic options:
    * download only data of interest i.e. only data selected by user (see below
      in BROWSE section)
    * download selected data with their basic context i.e. the data being on 
      the same level of data structure, but not selected by the user
    * download all data in the data-set
Rich download will let the user to work off-line in her or his favourite 
environment (e.g. spreadsheet application, statistic tool-kit) and choose, how 
much data she or he needs for that. 

TOOLBAR
Raw Salad uses a special always present toolbar with some additional 
functionality related to the current view. This functionality ranges from 
different download options to managing snapshots (see below in BROWSE section).
Special afford in the toolbar design is present in designing a functional 
patterns for the user while interacting with toolbar (e.g. constant download 
section behaviour for different views and download options). 

STATUS BAR
Toward all the views a special status bar is present at the bottom of the 
browser. It gives the user a live feedback about all interactive elements in 
the current view. After rolling mouse over some click-able element, the status 
bar shows a simple human readable instruction what functionality is attached to
the element (e.g. "Click here to see more details on National Budget data-set". 
The status bar is armed with a hide button, which minimalizes it to a single 
icon in the toolbar. To bring it back user has to click that icon.


THE VIEWS

CHOOSE
In this view user is presented with a list of available data-sets. Each position
in the list represents a single time independent data-set. That means that Raw 
Salad works on the structures of the data-sets instead of specific data, 
allowing to combine different issues of data in the same data-set (e.g. national
budget data-set contains budgets for years 2010, 2011 and 2012). 
After choosing one of the data-sets more information and options are provided 
without leaving a current view (accordion UI pattern). Additional information 
include: data-set description, lnks to data sources (e.g. Ministry of Finance 
for National Budget), legal status of data. Additional options include: download
all button and perspective switch.
The perspective switch allows user to choose the way data will be shown for her
or him in the data browser. The switch consists of two lists of perspectives: 
    * structures (obligatory for all data-sets): the basic raw data access point 
      providing basic data structures as a browser. E.g. Nation Budget 
      structures could be task-oriented budget or institutional budget, Local 
      Elections structures could be territorial structure or party based 
      structure. 
    * questions (or stories about data): some predefined perspectives on a 
      data-set that could be helpful to answer some questions (or to tell some 
      story about data). E.g. National Budget questions could be "National to EU
      money in the budget" Local Elections question could be "Women to men in 
      local elections". All the questions are prepared by the experts. 
Both structures and question (stories about data) give access to all the data 
in the data-set. The main difference between them is that the questions give 
the user easy access to some aggregations of data not included in raw structural
view by including them in the Basic Raw Data Table (see below in BROWSE 
section).
To move on from the Choose view to the Browse view user has to choose one of 
the perspectives. 

BROWSE
The BROWSE view is the view where user is provided with a direct access to data.
