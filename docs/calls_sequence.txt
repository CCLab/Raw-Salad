JavaScript code is divided into 10 modules:
- _algorithms: sorting and filtering data
- _assert: assertions
- _db: downloading data from server on web page
- _download: downloading data from chosen sheets on local machine
- _gui: creates most gui elements, defines their event handlers, makes zebra on presented data
- _sheet: creates sheets
- _store: contains sheets, handles adding new data to sheets and creating new groups, all data that is
          presented in tables comes from store module
- _table: creates table from pure data, adds new rows
- _tools: defines interface for sorting, filtering and creating new sheets
- _utils: defines functions used by many modules and not strictly connected with their role

The only module that has fields that represent its state is _store:
- meta_data: list containing information about data collections, its set once and for all when the web page is loaded,
             meta data has the following form:
             [
                  {
                      "idef": id,
                      "long_description": "abcabc",
                      "name": "abc",
                      "perspectives": [
                          {
                              "idef": id,
                              "description": "abc",
                              "long description" "abcabc",
                              "issues": [
                                  "xyz",
                              ]
                              "name": "qwe"
                          }
                      ]
                      "description": "abc"
                  }
             ]
- groups: list of groups of sheets, each group contains sheets with data from the same dataset, view and issue,
          new group can be only created by private _store function group(), this function is only called by
          _store.create_new_group()
- active_group_number: number of the currently chosen group, it is set to null only before any collection is chosen,
                       its value is only changed by _store.active_group()

State: web page is about to load, _store

1. Application start
   -> _store.meta_data( all_data_about_collections ) - meta data about all collections is saved in _store, it will never be changed
   -> _gui.init_gui() - initiate elements from gui, hide those that should appear when a table is present, create panel with collections
      -> hide all gui elements that should not be visible in init panel
      -> _tools.prepare_tools() - prepare event handlers for pressing sorting button, filtering button and new sheet button
      -> init_choose_panel() - get info about datasets from store, for each dataset create a (??)section to present it,
                               for each dataset define event handler that will show perspectives of this dataset
   
State: _store contains meta data about collections(meta data attribute is set to final value),
       all buttons are created and have defined their event handlers,
       buttons that should be visible when table is present are hidden,
       the panel with collections is created, all buttons have their event handlers defined,
       _store has its meta_data variable defined
      
2. Choosing dataset
   -> click event, event handler defined in _gui.init_choose_pane()
   -> create_perspectives_panel()
      -> _store.meta_perspectives( dataset_id ) - get info about perspectives of the chosen collection
      -> for each perspective create a (??)section to present it, such a (??)section will contain as many buttons as there are issues,
         that the perspective has, clicking on a button will show data of selected issue, if it it a collection that has not been
         downloaded yet, it will be downloaded, otherwise the basic sheet of selected collection will be shown,
         
State: a panel with perspectives of chosen dataset is created and shown, the panel with datasets is hidden,
       each issue from every perspective has its event handler defined, which will download initial data
       of chosen collection or show table with basic data of this collection, _store is not changed

3. Choosing an issue(an issue that has not been chosen yet)
   -> click event, an event handler defined in _gui.create_perspectives_panel()
   -> _store.create_new_group() - create a new group in _store that will contain sheets with data from this collection,
                                  list sheets of the group is empty, set active_group_number to new group's number
   -> _db.get_init_data() - send an Ajax call on server to get a-level nodes of selected collection
   
State: a new group in _store is created, it has no sheets in sheet list and its basic sheet is set to null,
       an Ajax call has just been sent, _store.active_group_number is set to number of created group,
       active sheet of the group is defaultly set to 0

4. Response from the server has come(with init_data)

   -> _store.init_basic_sheet() - initiate basic sheet of selected collection using data received from the server,
                                  for every row from data create a new row that will have two attributes: data from
                                  server and state(not opened and not selected), list of such modified rows is assigned to sheet,
                                  push a sheet created in the same way on the sheet list of the group
   -> _table.init_table() - create table header using basic columns and fill table with a-level rows
                            (there are only a-level rows in init data)
      -> _table.create_thead() - create html code for header of the table using schema of the downloaded data
      -> _table.create_tbody() - create html code for rows of the table(only a-level nodes in this situation),
                                 add an event handler for each row
      -> _gui.make_zebra() - change color of rows(to improve readability)

   -> _gui.init_app() - update gui(hide and show some elements), create a tab for a new group, add an event handler
                        to the tab, place it before 'save snapshot' button,
      -> _store.active_group(), _stotr.active_sheet() - set active_group_number to number of the active group in _store
                                                        and number of the active sheet in the group to index of the selected
                                                        sheet on the sheet list (!!) (redundant calls, active_group_number
                                                        was set in an issue's event handler and active_sheet_number does not
                                                        need to be set as it defaultly equals 0)
      -> _gui.create_sheet_tab() - create sheet tab
         -> _table.clean_table() - clean table(the table with the header is removed)
         -> _table.init_table() - the same as before (!!) (redundant call, table has just been initted and now its cleaned and inited
                                                          for the second time)
         -> _gui.make_zebra() - change color of rows (!!) (redundant call, make_zebra() has been called inside _table.init_table())
                               
State: in _store the new group has its basic sheet initiated and one sheet on its sheet list, each row of data in sheet is
       represented by an object which consists of data(original data) and state(opened, selected),
       state of each row is initially set to closed(unopened) and not selected,
       a previous table(if there was a previous table) is removed,
       new table is created, header has only basic columns, body of the table has only a-level nodes, zebra is applied,
       all nodes have their event handlers defined,
       new tab is created, it is active, previous active tab lost its active attribute

5. Opening node
   -> click event, an event handler defined in _table.generate_row()
   -> update css classes: root, next, dim
   -> _table.open_close_subtree()
      -> if its new node: _db.download_node() - send an Ajax call on server to get children of selected node(collection's
                                                attributes and parent id is sent)
         -> _store.add_data() - add downloaded data to the currently active sheet in the currently active group,
                                data objects saved in _store are created in the same way as in _store.init_basic_sheet() (see 4.)
         -> _table.add_node() - generate html code for new rows and add them to the table in the proper place, make zebra
         -> if the active sheet is basic sheet(its index is 0), mark basic sheet as changed in the group
      -> change state of rows in _store: the clicked node is now open, its a-ancestor is now selected
      
State: the active sheet has some rows added, a-ancestor of the clicked node is now selected, the node is open,
       the table has new rows added, their event handlers are defined, css classed of rows are updated
       
6. Closing node
   -> click event, an event handler defined in _table.generate_row()
   -> update css classes: root, next, dim
   -> _table.open_close_subtree()
      -> change state of rows in _store: the clicked node is now closed, if the clicked node is a-node, it is now not selected
      -> update table: hide children of selected node(and their children and so on), update css classes(also make new zebra)
      
State: state of clicked node in _store is changed: value open is set to false, it is a-node, also value selected is set to false,
       in the table children of clicked node are hidden, css classes of rows in the table are updated
       
7. Saving sheet
   -> click event('Zapisz arkusz' button clicked), an event handler defined in _tools.prepare_snapshot_interface()

   -> _sheet.create_new_sheet()
      -> _store.add_new_sheet() - create new sheet with the same data and push it on the list of sheets
                                  of the active group, update value of the active sheet number
      -> _gui.create_sheet_tab()
         -> create html code for a new tab and add it in the proper place
         -> define an event handler for the tab
         -> set new value of active sheet in the group (!!) (is it necessary?, add_new_sheet does the job)
         -> _table.clean_table(), _table.init_table() - clean table and make new table using data in the active sheet
            (!!) (is it necessary?)
         
State: active group has new sheet on its list, index of the active sheet is changed,
       new tab is created, it is now active, previous active tab losts its active parameter,
       a new table is created, the previous one is removed

8. Adding a new group
   -> click on 'Zmieñ dane' button, click event, an event handler defined in _gui.init_gui()
   -> _gui.show_choose_panel() - show panel with all perspectives of dataset which is dataset of a collection
                                 used to create present table

State: state of _store is not changed, choose_panel is visible, table is dimmed

   Next steps consists of the steps number 3 and 4.
   
State: the same as the state after 4.
   
9. Changing active sheet
   -> click event, an event handler define, in _gui.create_sheet_tab()
   -> update active attribute of tabs(recently active tab is not active anymore, clicked tab becomes active)
   -> _store.active_group(), _store.active_sheet() - update number of active group number and its active sheet number
   -> _table.clean_table(), _table.init_table() - clean previous table and create a new one basing on data of selected sheet
   
State: recently active tab losts its active attribute, clicked tab is active,
       values of active_group_number and number of active sheet are changed in the _store,
       previous table is cleaned and new table is created
   
10. Downloading pure data in csv format
   -> click event, an event handler defined in _gui.init_gui()
   -> _download.current_sheet() - create content of the csv file(header + data), send an Ajax call(POST) to the server
                                  with the content as value
      -> add_children() - recursively add data of children of specified node to the file
      -> send POST to the server(with action = '/download')
   
State: state is not changed, POST has just been sent to the server

   -> response of the server defined in databrowser/views.py in function: download_data
      -> download_data() - create Unicode encoded content of the csv file basing on data sent by POST, put it
                           in HttpResponse and send back to the browser
      
State: user gets data, saves it on the local machine
