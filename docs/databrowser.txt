Django structure:

There are 2 Django apps: databrowser and papi. Databrowser is an application used to present public data,
papi implements public api for databrowser.

Databrowser serves four kinds of urls:
a) "/"
b) "app/"
c) "download/"
d) "prepare_data"

Ad a) Django serves it in redirect(), which redirects to "app/"

Ad b) Django serves it in app_page(), returned response depends on parameters sent in GET.
      - if there are no parameters, starting web site should be send(template "app.html" filled with data from db),
        get_page() is called, uses function get_ms_nav() to get information about all collections in database
      
        get_ms_nav(): returns meta data about all collections what is used when loading page,
                      it is saved in _store in its meta_data list
              
           -> db= rsdb.DBconnect("mongodb").dbconnect - connects to MongoDB using the configuration file
           -> nav_full= rsdb.Navtree().get_nav_full(db) - gets list of all collections
      
      - if action parameter of object passed in GET is 'get_init_data',
        get_init_data() is called, sets up connection to MongoDB, gets initial data (data schema + a-level nodes)
        of collection(which is specified by other GET parameters: 'dataset', 'perspective' and 'issue')
        from database and sends it back to browser as HttpResponse
        
      - if action parameter of object passed in GET is 'get_node',
        get_node() is called, sets up connection to MongoDB, gets children nodes of selected node('parent' parameter)
        from collection(which is specified by other GET parameters: 'dataset', 'perspective' and 'issue')
        from database and sends it back to browser as HttpResponse
        
Ad c) Django serves it in download_data(), this function has to be tagged to provide protection against
      Cross Site Request Forgery,
      creates header of HttpResponse and adds content using UnicodeWriter, which creates Unicode encoded content
      of the csv file basing on data sent by POST, sends the response back to browser
      
Ad d) ??
