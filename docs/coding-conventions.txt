1. General documents

    Coding style standards for Python:

      PEP-020 - The Zen of Python (http://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0020/)
      PEP-008 - Style Guide for Python Code (http://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/)
      PEP-257 - Docstring Conventions (http://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0257/)
      
    Tools and utilities for Python:

      PyLint (http://pypi.python.org/pypi/pylint)
      DocUtils (http://docutils.sourceforge.net/)
 
 
    Coding style standards for JavaScript: 
    
      Code Conventions for JavaScript by Douglas Crockford 
      (http://javascript.crockford.com/code.html)
      
    Tools and utilities for JavaScript:

      JSLint (http://www.corybennett.org/projects/)
 

2. Indent style

    Use four spaces indents made with spaces not tabs. In JavaScript we use 1TBS
    indent style (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indent_style#Variant:_1TBS)
    Try to keep single lines not longer than 80 characters.

 

3. Naming conventions

    Use UpperCamelCase for class names. Use lower case names joint with underline
    in functions and variables names. Use self-documenting names.


4. Defensive programming

    Use asserts as a safty and test easining mechanism. Use asserts wherever the
    state of the program should be monitored. In Python use asserts instead of
    conditionals in assign statements. In JavaScript use assert.js file from src
    repo.
     

5. Don't use oneliners
