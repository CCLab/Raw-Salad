When I write it, I hope that future me will not have to read it.
If you read it, it must mean that something wrong with ids happened and
big changes in code must be done to satisfy new form of ids.
If you are future me, I'm sorry:(, if not, then ... hahahaha, sucker.

It turned out, that there might be a problem when hierarchy has holes:
e.g.
Dzial 2
--- Rozdzial 3
------ Paragraf 5
--- Paragraf 3

ids of those rows in old form would be:
0002
0002-0003
0002-0003-0005
0002-0003    ups, here is a problem

New form of id is: {level}{number}-{level}{number}-...

so those ids in new form would be:
a0002
a0002-b0003
a0002-b0003-c0005
a0002-c0003

It is possible, that this situation will not happen,
so these changes will have to be done when data validator
will detect it.
