Raw Salad
=========
Raw Salad is a web platoform for publishing open data. It's an initiative of Centrum Cyfrowe from Poland, a think & do tank focused on open government in Poland.

Up till August the main focus of the development is core infrastructure and publishing of a few datasets (all being part of polish public money) as a proof of concept. The collections are extremely different in their nature, so will let us meet all the potential problems and issues related to data publishing.
