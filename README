Raw Salad is a web platoform for publishing open data. It's an initiative of Centrum Cyfrowe from Poland, a think & do tank focused on open government in Poland.

Up till August the main focus of the development is core infrastructure and publishing of two different data sets as a proof of concept: Polish National Budget and data from Polish Local Elections 2010. The collections are extremely different in their nature, so will let us meet all the potential problems and issues related to data publishing.

Technically Row Salad makes use of four great technologies: 
- MongoDB
- Django Web Framework
- jQuery
- ProtoVis (a JavaScript visualization framework)

The main contributors are (in alpha order):
- Denis Kolokol - DB developer
- Jacek Malinowski - Information and graphic designer
- Ignacy Morawski - Expert in economy
- Bartosz Stalewski - Web developer
- Krzystof Trzewiczek - Project manager and front-end developer
